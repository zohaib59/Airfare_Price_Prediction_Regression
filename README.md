# Airfare_Price_Prediction_Regression
Just wrapped up a powerful **Airfare Price Prediction** project using 15+ machine learning models!

This project uses a collection of classic and advanced regression models to predict average airfare prices based on cleaned and preprocessed tabular data.

## 🚀 Features

- 🧼 Data cleaning & outlier removal
- 🔠 Label encoding of categorical variables
- 🔍 Model evaluation using RMSE, MAE, R², MAPE
- 🔁 5-Fold Cross-validation
- 📈 Residual distribution plots
- 🔮 15+ Regressors benchmarked
- 🛠️ SHAP support ready (for future feature explainability)


📦 What's Inside:
✅ Cleaned and preprocessed real-world airfare data  
✅ Label encoding + outlier removal  
✅ Comparison across 15 regression models (Linear, Tree-based, Boosting, etc.)  
✅ Cross-validation using K-Folds  
✅ Evaluation metrics: R², RMSE, MAE, and MAPE  
✅ Residual analysis with Seaborn visualizations  
✅ SHAP-ready pipeline for future model explainability  

📊 Models used:
- Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
- Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, SVR
- Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost
- AdaBoost, KNN, Bagging Regressor

📈 Purpose:
- Identify the most performant model for predicting airfare prices  
- Understand residuals and prediction errors  
- Explore model interpretability options for future deployment
